    To add some more relevancy to these numbers, we may compare them with some general stats.
    As seen in the above diagram, the average transportation related CO2-emissions per year and person was 1.7 tons 2018.
    Far from the goal of 1 ton per person and year in average global emissions (also seen in diagram) by the year of 2050,
    in order to achieve the <i>Generation Goal</i>, the environmental quality goal <i>Limited Climate Impact</i> and the <i>Paris Agreement goal</i>.

    Going by car to the selected destination results in {{ result.car.data.attributes.carbon_mt / form.passengers }} tons of CO2-emissions per passenger and is equal to
    {{ Math.round(((result.car.data.attributes.carbon_mt / form.passengers) / yearlyCO2) * 100) }} % of the average amount of transportation related CO2-emissions per year and citizen in Sweden ({{ yearlyCO2 }} tons),
    and {{ Math.round(((result.car.data.attributes.carbon_mt / form.passengers) / 1) * 100) }} % of the average amount of global emissions per year and person to achieve the above environmental goals (1 ton).

    Going by airplane to the selected destination results in {{ result.flight.data.attributes.carbon_mt / form.passengers }} tons of CO2-emissions per passenger and is equal to
    {{ Math.round(((result.flight.data.attributes.carbon_mt / form.passengers) / yearlyCO2) * 100) }} % of the average amount of transportation related CO2-emissions per year and citizen in Sweden ({{ yearlyCO2 }} tons),
    and {{ Math.round(((result.flight.data.attributes.carbon_mt / form.passengers) / 1) * 100) }} % of the average amount of global emissions per year and person to achieve the above environmental goals (1 ton).
